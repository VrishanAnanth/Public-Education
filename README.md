# Public-Education
This is an economic analysis of the performance of public schools in India before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

The scrape code scrapes data of all the top schools in the country based on a reccomended ranking system, we further have data of all the schools in india 
(size of the file extremely large), their types, no.of students, residential type etc, and fuzzy match the schools according to their ranking and 
curated total scores.

We complete the rest of the analysis on Stata and the project is currently a working paper about to be published in some of the top economic journal.
My contribution to the project was the web scraping, fuzzy matching, data analysis and some of the Economic regression code as well.

I worked on this project with my economics professor, Dr. Bheemeshwar Reddy
